# Our Python Project
#### :video_game: It is a video-game developed in  Python. I realized this project during my DUT. In one week, we had to develop a video game in python language. We developed this project with a group of 4 people.

##### The goal of this project is in the same principle as a race. 
###### :runner: We have a person who runs in the jungle and has to eat :peach: :strawberry: :pear: fruits to increase his :hearts: health.
###### If the person doesn't manage to eat fruits  before losing all his health. :skull_and_crossbones: He dies. 
###### :earth_africa: At that point, he sleeps and goes to another world where he fights monsters. He must kill 10 monsters to get back into the race.
###### :skull_and_crossbones: If the person dies, once again, he dies completely.
