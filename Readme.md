# Our Python Project
#### :video_game: It is a video-game developed in  Python. I realized this project during my DUT. In one week, we had to develop a video game in python language. We developed this project with a group of 4 people.

##### The goal of this project is in the same principle as a race. 
We have a person who runs in the jungle and has to eat fruits to increase his health.
If the person doesn't manage to eat fruits before losing all his health. He dies. At that point, he sleeps and goes to another world where he fights monsters. He must kill 10 monsters to get back into the race.
If the person dies, once again, he dies completely.
